To build Trusted Analytics platform from sources, all you need, is platform-parent project.

Go to: https://github.com/trustedanalytics/platform-parent and proceed with instructions from the README document.

Once it is done, you will have all of the Java components built and compiled. Among the cloned repositories you will have some non-Java components as well. To run them with the rest of the platform elements, follow the instructions of the README documents for the following repositories:

Python:
- data-catalog - https://github.com/trustedanalytics/data-catalog

Go:
- app-launcher helper - https://github.com/trustedanalytics/app-launcher-helper

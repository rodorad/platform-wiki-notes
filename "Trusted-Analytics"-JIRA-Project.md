There is a JIRA project for Trusted Analytics Platform: https://trustedanalytics.atlassian.net

This is the place where you can do the following:
* enter defects for platform components
* list all open & resolved defects for the project
* see the list of all open change/feature requests
* create change/feature requests

In the future, JIRA project will also contain plan for the couple nearest releases planned for the platform.

You can see the entries as anonymous user (you don't need to register as a legitimate users in project JIRA).

To be able to create items (defects, change requests, etc.) you will need to register as a user in project JIRA.

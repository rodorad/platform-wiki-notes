> As a data scientist, build a model for anomaly detection in a stream with multidimensional data.

Preconditions:
* The IntelÂ® Analytics Toolkit for Apache Hadoop* software toolkit already includes libraries for use in this model.
* Data is cleansed and formatted correctly. 
* The application maintains state of the most recent result. 
* An engine (rules, report, visualization, etc.) applies business logic to the result. 

Feature engineering:
* Identify features of predictive value. 
* Create features using ATK tools. 

Model training: 
* Acquire a training dataset. 
* Build a model/curve and test against data.

Model deployment:
* Model requires input: value. 
* Model returns output: mean, SD.
